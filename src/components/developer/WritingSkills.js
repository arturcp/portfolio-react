          Reading and writing are (a big) part of me. I tried to create <a href="http://teoriadobigbang.wordpress.com" target="_blank">a science blog</a> once, it went pretty well, and now I have a technology blog and I also wrote a book!
        </p>

        <p>
          The book is a <a href="http://www.joran.arenah.com.br/" target="_blank">medieval fantasy </a> and it is not published yet. To make it happen is one of my main goals right now, so maybe I will soon have good news to share. I also wrote a small chronicle <a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/Conspira%C3%A7%C3%A3o-Artur-Caliendo-ebook/dp/B011EWJP8U" target="_blank">that can be purchased on Amazon</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once I was invited to write <a href="http://minhavidaliteraria.com.br/2012/07/14/post-surpresa-da-semana-da-literatura-fantastica-por-que-ficcao-por-artur-prado/" target="_blank">a post to a famous literature blog</a> called Minha Vida Liter√°ria and it was a huge success.
        </p>

        <p>
          To complete the list of texts in Portuguese, I have been writing in <a href="https://labs.youse.com.br" target="_blank">Youse's technology blog</a>. Here is the list of my posts:
        </p>

        {this.listLinks(writings.youse)}

        <p>
          But I also write in English. I maintain <a href="https://medium.com/@artur.prado" target="_blank">my own blog on Medium</a> and, even though I have not been writing as much as I want, I like it very much. Here are my main articles:
